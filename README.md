# TEECOM Rails Templates

This repository contains Rails templates that we use to spin up new applications
quickly.

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant
[code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to

## Templates

Currently we only have one base template, but hopefully there will be more to
come!

- [`base`](./base) is a base template with minimal configuration. It includes
  setup that we do for nearly every new project, and doesn't make any
  assumptions about authentication.
